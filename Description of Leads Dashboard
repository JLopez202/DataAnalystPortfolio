My favorite side project involved assisting a local landscaping business owner with data synchronization. 
I automated the process by enabling his CRM system to communicate seamlessly with a master data sheet. 
Additionally, I integrated the data with DOMO, a powerful business intelligence tool that I set up for him. 
To provide actionable insights, I created a customized dashboard that allowed the owner to track lead trends 
and visualize their position within the sales funnel. It was a rewarding experience to help streamline 
their data management and empower them with valuable analytics.
